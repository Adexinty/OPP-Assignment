# Object-Oriented Programming Assignment

## Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class


- Created a `Book` class with `title` and `author`.
- Used a constructor to set values.
- Added a method `display_info()` to print book details.
- Created a subclass `SpecialBook` to show polymorphism using method overriding.




## Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge

- Created a base class `Vehicle`.
- Subclasses `Car`, `Plane`, and `Boat` each override the `move()` method.
